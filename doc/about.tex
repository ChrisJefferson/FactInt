This package for {\GAP} 4 provides routines for 
integer factorization, in particular:

\beginitems
Pollard's $p-1$&

Williams' $p+1$&

The Elliptic Curves Method (ECM)&

The Continued Fraction Algorithm (CFRAC)&

The Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS)&
\enditems

It makes also use of Richard P. Brent's tables of factors of integers of
the form $b^k \pm 1$.

FactInt is completely written in the {\GAP} language and contains /
requires no external binaries. No other packages are needed.
It must be installed in the `pkg' subdirectory of the
{\GAP} distribution.
