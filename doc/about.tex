{\sf FactInt} is distributed under the same conditions as the {\GAP}
system, i.e. under the GNU General Public License.

This package for {\GAP} 4 provides a general-purpose integer
factorization routine, which makes use of a combination of factoring
methods. In particular it contains implementations of the following
algorithms:

\beginitems
Pollard's $p-1$&

Williams' $p+1$&

The Elliptic Curves Method (ECM)&

The Continued Fraction Algorithm (CFRAC)&

The Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve (MPQS)&
\enditems

It also includes code by Frank L\accent127ubeck for making use of
Richard P. Brent's tables of factors of integers of the form $b^k \pm 1$.

{\sf FactInt} is completely written in the {\GAP} language and contains /
requires no external binaries. No other packages are needed.
It must be installed in the `pkg' subdirectory of the
{\GAP} distribution.
