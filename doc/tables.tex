\Chapter{Factorizations of Cyclotomic Numbers}

How to get factorizations of integers of the form $b^k \pm 1$ quickly
if $b$ is ``small'' and $k$ is rather ``large''?

Many of these numbers have already been factored by various people
using lots of CPU time on fast computers.

Factorizations of integers of this form are frequently needed for
example for computing orders of matrices over finite fields or orders of
elements in huge finite fields. For this reason, this package provides
access to the corresponding tables which have been collected by
Richard~P.~Brent~\cite{Brent04}. These tables are available on the web at

\URL{http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/oucl/work/richard.brent/factors.html}.

The factors listed there are silently used by the general factorization
routine.

The code for converting Brent's tables into \GAP - readable form has been
written by Frank~L\accent127ubeck.
