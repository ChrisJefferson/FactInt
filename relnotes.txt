                     Version history of the FactInt package
                     ======================================

Initial version: 1.0 (July 1999)

Changes between version 1.0 and version 1.1:

 - MPQS uses the fast special-purpose kernel routine ADD_TO_LIST_ENTRIES_PLIST_RANGE
   for the innermost loop of the sieving routine.
   The kernel routine was implemented in src/listoper.c by Steve Linton.

Changes between version 1.1 and version 1.2:

 - The manual is now also available in PDF and Postscript format.
 - The documentation has been cleaned up typographically.
 - Info messages for factorizations of small integers are now given only
   if InfoLevel(IntegerFactorizationInfo) = 3 to avoid the user to be swamped with
   messages for factorizations of numbers like 4 or so if he does not want to.
 - The declaration of `IntegerFactorizationInfo' is now in factint.gd, as it should.

Changes between version 1.2 and version 1.3:

 - The overhead for factoring very small numbers was reduced.
 - The synonym `InfoFactInt' for `IntegerFactorizationInfo' was added.
 - A restriction concerning the number of digits of some argument values
   in Info messages was removed (this concerns mainly the ECM).
 - The default of the number of curves to be tried by FactorsECM for large
   numbers before invoking the MPQS was increased.
 - Introduced Info levels 4 and 5 for more frequent status messages during
   the sieving process of the MPQS.

Changes between version 1.3 and version 1.3.1:

 - Adaptation to the new package loading and updating mechanism of GAP 4.4.
 
Changes between version 1.3.1 and version 1.4:

 - Improved the performance of the factoring routine for integers of the
   form b^k +/- 1.

 - Access to Richard P. Brent's tables of factors of integers of the
   form b^k +/- 1. (Only under Unix.)
