                     Version history of the FactInt package
                     ======================================

Initial Version: 1.0 (July 1999)

Changes between version 1.0 and version 1.1:

 - MPQS uses the fast special-purpose kernel routine ADD_TO_LIST_ENTRIES_PLIST_RANGE
   for the innermost loop of the sieving routine.
   The kernel routine was implemented in src/listoper.c by Steve Linton.

Changes between version 1.1 and version 1.2:

 - The documentation has been cleaned up typographically.
 - The manual is now also available in PDF and Postscript format.
 - Info messages for factorizations of small integers are now given only
   if InfoLevel(IntegerFactorizationInfo) = 3 to avoid the user to be swamped with
   messages for factorizations of numbers like 4 or so if he does not want to.
 - The declaration of `IntegerFactorizationInfo' is now in factint.gd, as it should.
